## ⚙️ About

This is the source code for my website [8n1.net](https://8n1.net).

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repo**

    Start by cloning the repository to your device

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dmccrthy/8n1.net
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    From here you should navigate to the site folder and install the dependencies

    ```shell
    cd 8n1.net
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Website**

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

    From here the site should be running at http://localhost:3000

4.  **Build for Production**

    Run the following command to statically generate the site.

    ```shell
    npm run generate
    ```

    This should create a ./dist folder with the complete static site. Unlike webpack, this will include the html for all pages.
