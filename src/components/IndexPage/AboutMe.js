          Hi again! My name is Dan and I'm a Computer Science student interested
          in all things software development, and cybersecurity. Iâ€™m currently
          working towards a BS in Computer Science at the University of New
          Hampshire and in my free time I like to work on different projects in
          a number of different languages which you can find on my github.
        </p>
