          <h1>Hi, I'm Dan</h1>
          <p>I'm a student passionate about working in Computer Science and IT. Iâ€™m in my 3rd year of Computer Networking and currently serve as the Captain of our CyberPatriot team. Through these endeavors and many more, I have learned both technical and teamwork skills which I hope to develop further. In the future, I hope to continue learning and plan to focus on my interest in Computer Science as I go on to higher education.</p>
